# LevelEditor2D
This is my unfinished Level Editor that started out as a school project but got scrapped in the middle of development.
It's a 2D Map creator that was mading using C# and XNA for the content and content library capabilities of XNA which would help with the overall performance of the editor.
THe editor is unfinished but the main functionality is there. You can load sprite sheets and select pieces of them and lay them out over a blank map file.
